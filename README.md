# Twiglet: Ruby version

This library provides a minimal JSON logging interface suitable for use in (micro)services. See the [README](../README.md) for design rationale and an explantion of the Elastic Common Schema that we are using for log attribute naming.

## Installation

```bash
gem install twiglet
```

## How to use

Create a new logger like so:

```ruby
require 'logger'
logger = Logger.new(conf: { service: 'petshop' })
```

The logger may be passed in the configuration object an optional `output` attribute which should be an object with a `puts` method - like `$stdout`. The configuration object may also have an optional `now` attribute, which should be a function returning a `Time` object. The defaults should serve for most uses, though you may want to override them for testing as we have done [here](test/logger_test.rb).

To use, simply invoke like most other loggers:

```ruby
logger.error({ event: { action: 'startup' }, message: "Emergency! There's an Emergency going on" })
```

This will write to STDOUT a JSON string:

```json
{"service":{"name":"petshop"},"@timestamp":"2020-05-14T10:54:59.164+01:00","log":{"level":"error"},"event":{"action":"startup"},"message":"Emergency! There's an Emergency going on"}
```

Obviously the timestamp will be different.

Add log event specific information simply as attributes in a hash:

```ruby
logger.info({
  event: { action: 'HTTP request' },
  message: 'GET /pets success',
  trace: { id: '1c8a5fb2-fecd-44d8-92a4-449eb2ce4dcb' },
  http: {
    request: { method: 'get' },
    response: { status_code: 200 }
  },
  url: { path: '/pets' }
})
```

This writes:

```json
{"service":{"name":"petshop"},"@timestamp":"2020-05-14T10:56:49.527+01:00","log":{"level":"info"},"event":{"action":"HTTP request"},"message":"GET /pets success","trace":{"id":"1c8a5fb2-fecd-44d8-92a4-449eb2ce4dcb"},"http":{"request":{"method":"get"},"response":{"status_code":200}},"url":{"path":"/pets"}}
```

It may be that when making a series of logs that write information about a single event, you may want to avoid duplication by creating an event specific logger that includes the context:

```ruby
request_log = logger.with({ event: { action: 'HTTP request'}, trace: { id: '1c8a5fb2-fecd-44d8-92a4-449eb2ce4dcb' }})
```

This can be used like any other Logger instance:

```ruby
request_logger.error({
    message: 'Error 500 in /pets/buy',
    http: {
        request: { method: 'post', 'url.path': '/pet/buy' },
        response: { status_code: 500 }
    }
})
```

which will print:

```json
{"service":{"name":"petshop"},"@timestamp":"2020-05-14T10:58:30.780+01:00","log":{"level":"error"},"event":{"action":"HTTP request"},"trace":{"id":"126bb6fa-28a2-470f-b013-eefbf9182b2d"},"message":"Error 500 in /pets/buy","http":{"request":{"method":"post","url.path":"/pet/buy"},"response":{"status_code":500}}}
```

## Use of dotted keys

Writing nested json objects could be confusing. This library has a built-in feature to convert dotted keys into nested objects, so if you log like this:

```ruby
logger.info({
    'event.action': 'HTTP request',
    message: 'GET /pets success',
    'trace.id': '1c8a5fb2-fecd-44d8-92a4-449eb2ce4dcb',
    'http.request.method': 'get',
    'http.response.status_code': 200,
    'url.path': '/pets'
})
```

or mix between dotted keys and nested objects:

```ruby
logger.info({
    'event.action': 'HTTP request',
    message: 'GET /pets success',
    trace: { id: '1c8a5fb2-fecd-44d8-92a4-449eb2ce4dcb' },
    'http.request.method': 'get',
    'http.response.status_code': 200,
    url: { path: '/pets' }
})
```

Both cases would print out exact the same log item:

```json
{"service":{"name":"petshop"},"@timestamp":"2020-05-14T10:59:31.183+01:00","log":{"level":"info"},"event":{"action":"HTTP request"},"message":"GET /pets success","trace":{"id":"1c8a5fb2-fecd-44d8-92a4-449eb2ce4dcb"},"http":{"request":{"method":"get"},"response":{"status_code":200}},"url":{"path":"/pets"}}
```
